# jcommons

An evolving toolkit of common utilities in several categories, mostly removed of
any redundancies with Apache Commons libraries, upon which this library depends.

As the overall file set is still fairly small, I am disinclined to break this up
into multiple libraries at the moment, and also reserve the right to delete
methods and classes as I continue to evaluate better alternatives that already
exist in various Apache Commons libraries and elsewhere.

Note that some of this code may become unnecessary before long, as there is an
existing JSR for Units and Unit Conversion, but I haven't had a chance to
re-find it and check its status recently. I also need to add more units than the
ones included here, which are the most common ones but aren't complete for all
applications.

Until I publish to Maven Central or elswehere, I am attempting to provide
pre-built JAR files for binary builds, source code, and Javadocs.

There has been yet another shift in how/where the proxy-vole library is
published, so I will try to find time to upgrade that dependency library soon.

Although there are other libraries with this name, I want to get away from my
verbose original name-collision-avoidance names while maintaining a unified and
simple theme.
