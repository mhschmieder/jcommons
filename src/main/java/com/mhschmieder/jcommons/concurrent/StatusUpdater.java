     * Updates the status, usually of a concurrent task on another thread.
     * <p>
     * Implementers should add this interface to classes that deal with Tasks.
     * <p>
     * As one example, in the JavaFX Service API context, an override would call
     * updateMessage() if the message is null and non-empty, and then it would
     * call updateProgress() with the work done and the total work involved.
     * <p>
     * As total work may be dynamically modified in some calling contexts, in
     * particular when Machine Learning algorithms are in play, it is necessary
     * to provide this parameter on each call even if it never changes.
     * <p>
     * Some downstream use may need to cast longs to doubles, if storing work
     * done as a ratio of the total number of tasks.
     *
     * @param workDone The amount of work done, unitless in {0..totalWork} range
     * @param totalWork The total amount of work expected, unitless
     * @param message An optional message to update related to current status
